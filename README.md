This is a very *simple* application. It creates a random (and **almost certainly** false) historical fact.

### How it works
- Arrays are initialised, containing random assortments of places, people, and events.
- Items are randomly selected from these arrays.
- Random years and ages are generated.
- The randomised data is put into a template sentence.
- Logged to console.
